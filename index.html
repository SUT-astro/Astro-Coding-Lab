        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>March, the beginning of Spring.

            At a corner of the eastern part of Nanhuang* Continent.
            
            The hazy sky was a stretch of gray and black, emitting a heavy sense of oppression. It was as if someone had splattered ink on drawing paper, allowing the ink to soak the sky, smudging the clouds.
            
            The clouds folded over each other, merging together. After that, streaks of red lightning could be seen shooting out, accompanied by thunderous rumbling sounds.
            
            The sounds were akin to the low-sounding roars of Gods reverberating through the mortal world.
            
            The blood-colored rain emanated sorrow, falling onto mortal soil.
            
            In the vast land, there was a ruined city. It looked devoid of vitality as it sat silently under the hazy blood-colored rain.
            
            Within the fragmented city walls, desolation and dilapidation painted the scene bleak. Everything was withering, and collapsed houses could be seen everywhere. One could also find numerous greenish-black corpses and torn flesh around that resembled crumbling autumn leaves as they silently withered.
            
            The once-bustling streets were now in shambles.
            
            The sandy paths that were once crowded with people were now silent.
            
            The only things that remained were shredded flesh, dust, and paper mixed with blood-soaked mud to the extent that one was indistinguishable from another. It was an extremely shocking sight.
            
            Not far away, a broken carriage could be seen deep in the mud. Degrees of deterioration could clearly be seen on it, and the only thing there was an abandoned bunny puppet that was tied onto the carriage's shaft, gently swaying with the wind.
            
            Its white-colored fur was long dyed red, exuding a gloomy and eerie aura.
            
            Its cloudy eyes seemed to contain some resentment as it stared lonely at the mottled stones ahead.
            
            A figure could be seen lying there.
            
            This was a youth that seemed around 13 to 14 years old. His clothes were tattered and filled with dirt. Also, there was a damaged leather pouch tied to his waist.
            
            The youth squinted his eyes as he lay there unmoving. The bone-piercing chill seeped through the holes of his clothes from all directions, enveloping his entire body, gradually causing his body temperature to dip.
            
            But even when the rain fell onto his face, he didn't blink. He was coldly staring at a place far away like an eagle.</p>
